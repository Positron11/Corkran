Greetings, {{ user.get_username }}. You seem to have password trouble.

You've reported that you have forgotten your password. News to you? Well, someone's making an attempt on your account, then. But
worry not, they won't get it. Feel free to ignore this. If, however, it was you, initiate the password reset process for your account by clicking the link below:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password-reset-confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If clicking the link above doesn't work, copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.
