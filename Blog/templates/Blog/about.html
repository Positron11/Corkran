		Some write. Even fewer want others to see. And a lot less write something worthy of being seen. That
		last part is something that may as well be ignored. Here, is where you can put just about anything you 
		want up for everyone to see, provided that's what you want. Or perhaps you just want to write, or maybe 
		read what others have written. It's a free land, this. Do what you will. Here, what you write is who you 
		are. This blog was created, and is maintained entirely by one <a href="{% url 'author-sorted-articles' 'OunceOfShag' %}">person</a>. 
		What this means, that if you've got	any improvements, suggestions, or new features you'd like to see
		(that aren't completely muddle-headed), you can	<a href="mailto:aarushbeleren11@gmail.com?Subject=From a Corkran User">email</a> 
		me about the same.
